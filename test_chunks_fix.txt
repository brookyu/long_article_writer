The document processing pipeline should extract this text, create chunks from it, generate embeddings, and store both in Milvus and SQL databases.

This is a second paragraph to ensure we have enough content for multiple chunks. The chunking algorithm should split this text into meaningful segments.

This is the third paragraph with additional content to make sure the document has sufficient text for proper chunking and processing.
