New test document with multiple paragraphs for chunk testing.

This document should be processed properly and create several chunks. The text processing pipeline should extract this content and divide it into meaningful segments.

Each paragraph should become a separate chunk or be combined intelligently based on the chunking algorithm. This will test if our fixes work correctly.
